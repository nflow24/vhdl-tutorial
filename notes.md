**DD notes**
- combinational logic in HDL must be written without 
    memory or incomplete assignments, else infer latches
- don't need to worry about optimizing logic
- not going to use latches in this course
  - latches are asynchronnous
  - flip-flops are synchronous
- flip-flop vs latch
  - edge-triggered vs level-triggered
  - flip-flops are more robust
- area vs latency tradeoff for designs

**Embedded**
- specification
  - hardware runs in parallel -> needs exception handling
  - model of computation = specification language
  - don't include intermediaries in FSMs in variables
